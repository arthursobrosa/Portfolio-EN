Hello! My name is <b>Arthur Sobrosa</b> and I'm an <b>iOS developer</b>. I also study computer science at UFRGS - Brazil. I am participating in the 
<b>Apple Developer Academy</b> program in Porto Alegre for a year and have been building up knowledge in this area since then.

In 2024, I was one of the winners of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift-student-challenge/">Swift Student Challenge</a>, which awards 350 students
of Swift around the world and this pushed me to continue learning and improving my skills in this language.

I am familiar with <b>SwiftUI</b>, <b>UIKit</b> and some other native frameworks, such as <b>SpriteKit</b>, <b>GameKit</b>, <b>ARKit< /b>, <b>RealityKit</b>,
<b>CoreData</b>, <b>CloudKit</b> and <b>Combine</b>.
